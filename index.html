<h1 style="color:blue;">Homebound</h1>
<p style="color:green;">Welcome   
  Currently Selected Direction: Northbound   
  Selected Stop: Pulaski and Lawrence  
  Insane drivers ripping through the city   
  Strange light patterns leading to the river   
  </p>

<p style="color:green;">Just look for broken glass and    
  A freaking fire hydrant without a way out    
  More Poles, plus a sign in Korean    
  Itâ€™s been dark for a while now    
  Dazzled neon deserved a better look
