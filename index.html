<p>Welcome </p>
Currently Selected Direction: Northbound </p>
Selected Stop: Pulaski and Lawrence </p>
Insane drivers ripping through the city </p> 
Strange light patterns leading to the river </p>
Just look for broken glass and  </p>
A freaking fire hydrant without a way out  </p>
More Poles, plus a sign in Korean  </p>
Itâ€™s been dark for a while now  </p>
Dazzled neon deserved a better look  </p>
